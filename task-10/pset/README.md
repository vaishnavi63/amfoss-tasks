# Task-10
## My Approach
**pset-0**

While watching the lecture 0 I'm very excited to develop a small game using scratch.\
Heading towards problem set we are asked to implement a project with some specific requirements.\
Intially after seeing those requirements I'm bit tensed whether I reach those requirements or not.\
But once i started doing I lot of new things and I didn't even reliased that I've completed my project with all requirements.
