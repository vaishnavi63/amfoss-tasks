# Task-4  
## My Approach
Firstly I installed java and compiled the code in ubuntu using the references given,then I found some syntax errors like missing of semi colon's . I fixed those errors and as I don't have idea of debugging code, at one place I changed the code and replaced it with the one given by compiler.Because of that errors, increased more.

So I deleted the edited code and again started from beginning. I thought I have fixed all syntax errors and I compiled code all of sudden 100 errors got landed in my terminal. I was shocked by seeing 100 errors.

Then I thought of checking code again. While I'm going through code I found that in start of code a line is commented which import a library so I uncommented it and run code again.

That's it a calculator displayed on my screen. I fixed the bugs like syntax errors,logical errors. I tested out each feature, upto me it worked well.
