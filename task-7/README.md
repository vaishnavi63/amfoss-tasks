# Task-7
## My Approach
Firstly I have gone through the references given.As I don't know anything about flutter and dart language,I have watched some videos in youtube then I got some idea about it.

I started searching in google all about what I needed. I found a code,taking it as reference I started writing my code. First I had concentrated on sliding tabs,then I represented sliding dots in simple dot indicator format.

After finishing sliding tabs portion with text in the tabs,I started adding images to my tabs. After adding images to my tabs I thought that would be enough to submit my task. But in the given sample UI they represented sliding dots in different format so I started searching for that type of representation.

I refered flutter official documentation and edited my code. So finally I changed sliding dots representation from simple dot indicator format to expanding dot indicator format.
